## Overview

This page explains how to connect your own domain so Alex can send emails on your behalf (for example, interview invitations and reminders). Using your own domain improves deliverability and keeps communications on-brand for candidates.

Alex uses a provider behind the scenes for sending email, but the setup happens entirely inside your Alex workspace and your DNS provider.

## Uses

Connecting a domain allows Alex to send:

- Interview invitations
- Interview reminders
- Interview completion notifications

These emails appear to come from your organization’s domain instead of a generic Alex address, which:

- Builds trust with candidates
- Reduces the risk of messages landing in spam
- Keeps your employer brand consistent

## Setting up a custom domain

To connect a custom domain:

1. Log in to your Alex dashboard.
2. Navigate to **Settings**.
3. Open the **Domains** tab.
4. Click **Add New Domain**.
5. Enter the domain you want Alex to send from (for example, `jobs.yourcompany.com`) and click **Save**.
6. You’ll be taken to the configuration page for that domain.
7. Copy the provided TXT, MX, and any other DNS records into your DNS provider’s settings.
   - You’ll need access to your DNS control panel (often via your IT team).
   - Add each record exactly as shown.
8. After updating DNS, return to Alex and click **Verify**.
9. Once verification succeeds, you’ll see the domain marked as verified.
10. Use the dropdown to set this as your **default sending domain** (you can add multiple domains and choose one as default).

After this, emails Alex sends on your behalf will use that domain as the **From** address.

If you run into issues with DNS or verification, your IT team or domain host can help confirm records are correct. You can also contact Alex support via the address listed in the Domains page for help.

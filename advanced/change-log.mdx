## Change Log

This page will host Alex’s public changelog, including product updates, improvements, and bug fixes. The team plans to publish a running list of changes here so you can quickly see what’s new.

Right now, the public changelog is not yet live.

## How to get updates today

Until this page is fully populated, you can:

- Ask your Alex contact or CSM about recent releases.
- Check in-product announcements and emails for feature updates.

## Share feedback and feature requests

You can send ideas, questions, and feedback directly to the product team via the email address listed on this page so they can incorporate your input into future updates.

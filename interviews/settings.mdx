## Overview

The **Settings** tab is where admins configure platform-wide behavior:

- Branding and team membership
- Default interview behavior and AI interviewer configuration
- Cheat detection thresholds and notifications
- Job generation rules for ATS integrations
- Billing details and usage
- PDF report layout
- Personal profile preferences

Use these settings to make Sabina feel like a natural extension of your recruiting process.

## General

Manage key team and branding settings:

- **Company logo** – Upload a PNG (for example, 300×300) for use in reports and candidate-facing views.
- **Team members** – Invite and manage users. Common roles:
  - **Admin** – Full access including Settings and Billing.
  - **Recruiter** – Can create and edit jobs and view reports; no settings access.
  - **Evaluator** – Read-only interview and report access.
- **Email notifications** – Enable or disable email notifications so team members get alerts when candidates complete interviews for jobs they own.

Tip: If you’re approaching your seat limit, reach out to the Sabina team to add more users.

## Interviews

Use this section to configure defaults for new interviews.

### AI interviewer setup

- **Interviewer name** – The name the AI uses when speaking to candidates (default is “Sabina”; you can rename it).
- **Profile picture** – Candidate-facing avatar for video interviews (PNG, square dimensions recommended).
- **Voice** – Select from available voices to match your brand’s tone.

### Default interview template

Choose a template that pre-populates:

- Introduction script
- Core questions
- Ending or wrap-up message

You can still customize each job’s interview individually.

**Example structure (paraphrased):**

- **Introduction** – Greet the candidate and explain that an AI interviewer will guide them.
- **Core questions** – Ask about their background, motivation for the role, and past problem-solving experience.
- **Ending** – Thank the candidate and invite them to ask questions about the role or company.

### Cheat detection threshold

Configure the threshold used to flag interviews for potential cheating:

- The threshold is a number from 0–100.
- If an interview’s cheat score meets or exceeds the threshold, it’s flagged for review.
- Indicators include behaviors like background voices, frequent tab switching, and unusual delays before responding.

<Note>
Cheat Detection is an add-on. If you don’t see this setting, contact your Sabina representative to learn more.

### Interview schedule notifications

Enable notifications when interviews are scheduled:

- Recruiters receive emails when candidates schedule interviews.
- Users must also have notifications enabled under **General** to receive these.

### Video interview welcome message

Customize a welcome message shown before candidates start a video interview. For example, you might:

- Explain how the AI interviewer works.
- Clarify when recording starts and stops.
- Encourage candidates to relax and respond naturally.

You can rewrite this message in your own tone while keeping expectations clear.

### Accommodation requests

Specify an email address candidates can use to request accommodations (for example, extended time or alternative formats).

### Global interview context

Global context is shared across all interviews and used to answer general candidate questions about your company.

Consider including:

- Mission and values
- Overview of the interview process
- Office locations and remote or hybrid policies
- High-level benefits and culture notes
- What candidates can expect after completing the interview

You can also add job-specific context in each interview kit. Think of global context as an “about the company” section that Sabina can reference everywhere.

## Labels

Labels help you organize and filter interviews.

Common patterns:

- By client (for agencies): Nike, PepsiCo, Amazon
- By department: Engineering, Marketing, Sales
- By hiring priority: Urgent, High volume, Backfill
- By role type: Senior, Entry-level, Internship, Contract

Tip: Decide on a labeling convention and stick to it; consistency makes reporting and filtering much easier.

## Job generation

If you’re using an ATS integration, **Job Generation** can automatically create jobs and interviews in Sabina when new jobs appear in your ATS.

### What auto job generation does

When enabled, Sabina can:

- Detect new jobs in your ATS.
- Create corresponding jobs in Sabina with your default settings.
- Automatically invite applicants to complete interviews for those jobs.

This reduces manual setup and makes it easier to scale hiring across many openings.

### Job generation settings

You can configure:

- **Default workflow** – The workflow used for interviews created via job generation.
- **Default job description field** – ATS field that contains the JD text (for example, `description`).
- **Default job title field** – ATS field for the job title (for example, `job_title`).
- **Default job status** – Status applied to auto-created jobs in Sabina (for example, Active).
- **Job generation field mappings** – Additional ATS fields to pass into Sabina (for example, seniority, compensation, location).
- **Enable Auto Job Gen** – Toggle to turn automatic job creation on or off.
- **Default job type** – Whether generated jobs use phone or video interviews by default.
- **Default creation template** – Template used for interviews created via job generation.
- **Job generation filters** – Rules to include or exclude jobs (for example, only open jobs, exclude internal or test roles).

Tips:

- Use mappings to give Sabina richer context (for example, seniority and region).
- Use filters to avoid clutter from non-hireable or internal requisitions.
- Align with recruiters on the default workflow before turning this on.

## Billing

Manage your subscription and monitor usage:

- **Payment method** – Add or update billing details.
- **Usage** – Track completed interviews and remaining capacity for the current period.

Tip: If you’re regularly hitting your usage limit or planning a hiring surge, contact the Sabina team to adjust your plan.

## PDF settings

Control the layout and content of candidate PDF reports.

### How it works

- Toggle individual sections on or off.
- Reorder sections via drag-and-drop to match how your reviewers prefer to read reports.

### Available report elements

You can include:

- **Skill report** – Summary of key skills and performance across each.
- **Question report** – List of questions and the candidate’s responses.
- **Video recording** – Embedded or linked video of the interview (if available).
- **Interview transcript** – Full text transcript of the conversation.
- **Candidate feedback** – Any end-of-interview feedback submitted by the candidate.

Tip: Customize report layouts for different stakeholders (for example, a concise version for hiring managers vs. a detailed version for recruiters).

## Profile

Each user can manage their own profile settings:

- **Name** – Update your display name.
- **User type** – See whether you’re an Admin, Recruiter, or Evaluator.
- **Notifications** – Adjust email notification preferences.

Tip: If you need to change your login email, contact an admin or reach out to the Sabina support contact listed in your workspace.

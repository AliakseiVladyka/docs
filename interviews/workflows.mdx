description: "How to configure Sabina workflows to automate invitations, reminders, status updates, and decisions for candidates across ATS and non-ATS flows."

## Overview

Workflows define the end-to-end journey a candidate takes, from their first invite through the final hiring decision. They control:

- How and when candidates are invited
- Which messages they receive (texts, calls, emails)
- How status changes are logged
- When recruiters are notified
- How ATS fields are updated

## ATS vs. non-ATS workflows

- **Without ATS integration** – You’ll see a single branch. This branch represents candidates invited directly from Sabina (for example, via invite link or **Invite Candidates** button).
- **With ATS integration** – You’ll see two branches:
  - Left branch: Candidates invited directly from Sabina or via manually shared links.
  - Right branch: Candidates invited automatically from your ATS.

Each branch has its own configuration so you can personalize the journey based on candidate source.

## Workflow tutorial

Use the steps in the workflow builder to configure each stage of the candidate journey.

### 1. Start

#### Blackout period (phone interviews only)

The blackout period prevents Sabina from calling or texting candidates during off-hours:

- Sabina only sends initial calls or texts during your configured window (shown in green).
- The candidate’s local timezone is inferred from their phone’s area code.
- If someone applies overnight, their invite waits until the next available window.

Note: If candidates text Sabina themselves, Sabina will respond right away. The blackout period only affects outbound calls and texts.

#### Shared notifications for completed interviews (Bullhorn only)

You can configure multiple recipients to be notified when interviews are completed. Notifications can be routed using fields such as:

- `JobOrder`: `owner`, `responseUser`
- `Candidate`: `owner`, `linkedPerson`

This ensures the right recruiters stay informed, even in team-based setups.

### 2. Submission / Default

This step triggers when a candidate is invited to an interview.

- **Without ATS** – No extra setup required.
- **With ATS** – Additional configuration appears to control auto-invites and logging.

#### ATS-specific settings (right branch)

You can configure:

- **Invitation rules** – Filters that determine which candidates should automatically receive interview invites (for example, by role, location, or other criteria).
- **Resume fit threshold** – Minimum resume fit score required before sending an invite (where resume data is available).
- **Update candidate field** – Automatically log a custom message in the ATS activity field.
- **Upload resume fit score** – Store the fit score in a designated ATS field when an invite is sent.
- **Note actions** – Add custom notes in the ATS when the candidate is invited.
- **One interview per candidate** – Prevent multiple invites if the candidate applies to several roles; they only receive one interview per day.
- **Invitation delay** – Add a delay between the trigger event and when the invite is sent (beyond the built-in default delay).

#### Outbound outreach workflows

If you do outbound sourcing and send interview links to candidates who haven’t applied through the ATS:

- Enable **Auto Match Candidates** in the **Default** node on the left branch.
- This automatically creates candidate records and job submissions in your ATS once candidates complete their interviews.

### 3. Outreach

Use this step to manage invites and reminders.

1. **Create the invite**
   - In the **Outreach** step, click **Add Invitation**.
   - If a phone number is set up, you can send both text and email invites.
   - Without a phone number, only email is available.
   - Customize the message to match your brand’s voice.
2. **Add reminders**
   - Add one or more reminders under the invite.
   - Reminders can be sent via text, call, or email.
   - Configure them for specific offsets (for example, X hours or days after the invite).
   - Reminders stop automatically once the candidate schedules or completes the interview.

#### Determining phone vs. video interviews

Whether a candidate takes a phone or video interview depends on how they engage with your outreach:

1. **Email = always video**
   - Email invites and reminders always contain a video link, so they direct candidates to a video interview.
   - Phone interviews cannot be scheduled via email.
2. **Text = depends on the presence of a video link**
   - Text with a video link → leads to a video interview.
   - Text without a video link → leads to a phone interview.
3. **Mixed outreach (email + text)**
   - When both channels exist, whichever message the candidate acts on first determines the interview type.

Decision summary:

- Email invite or reminder → Video
- Text + video link → Video
- Text without video link → Phone

Best practice: Decide on your preferred interview type upfront and keep messaging consistent to avoid splitting candidates between phone and video flows.

### 4. Progress

The **Progress** step tracks the time from invite to completion and can trigger actions based on status:

- **SCHEDULED** – Automatically log notes or update ATS fields when a candidate schedules an interview.
- **MISSED** – Log notes, update ATS fields, and optionally send follow-up emails when interviews are missed.

These automations keep your ATS up to date and reduce manual tracking.

### 5. Complete

This step is triggered once the candidate finishes the interview.

You can configure:

- **Candidate emails** – Confirmation or next-step messages (for example, thanking them for completing the interview).
- **Recruiter emails** – Notifications when interviews are completed.

#### Additional options

1. **Multi-recipient notifications (Bullhorn only)**
   - Notify multiple recruiters instead of just the job creator.
   - Use fields such as:
     - `JobOrder`: `owner`, `responseUser`
     - `Candidate`: `owner`, `linkedPerson`
2. **Score threshold for notifications**
   - Only candidates above a specified score (for example, 80) trigger recruiter emails.
   - This controls who gets notified, not the content of the emails.

#### ATS-specific settings (Complete step)

You can configure automatic ATS updates when interviews complete:

- **Update field** – Write a custom value to an ATS activity field.
- **Upload interview score** – Store the overall interview score in a dedicated ATS field.
- **Upload report PDF** – Attach the full report PDF to the candidate’s ATS profile.
- **Upload question summary** – Store a structured summary of the candidate’s answers.
- **Note action** – Create a custom note describing the completion.

### 6. Decision (optional)

Use the **Decision** step to automate what happens when you shortlist or reject candidates in Sabina:

- Optionally send email or SMS notifications when candidates are shortlisted or rejected.
- Customize templates to fit your tone and process.

For Bullhorn users:

- Sabina can create note actions or update fields when candidates are shortlisted or rejected, so the ATS reflects the decision made in Sabina.

Important limitations:

- For ATSs other than Bullhorn, decisions made in the ATS do not sync back to Sabina.
- Decisions made in Sabina can trigger notifications, but not every ATS supports mirrored status updates.

## Important note on workflows

If you manually copy and send interview or scheduling links outside Sabina (for example, a bare link in email or chat), the candidate bypasses parts of your workflow. That means:

- They may not receive automated reminders or completion emails.
- ATS updates may not run as expected.

To keep everything in sync:

- Add candidates via the **Invite Candidates** button in Sabina, or
- Route them through ATS-based automations.

If you need to share links during outbound outreach, enabling **Auto Match Candidates** ensures that completed interviews still create candidate records in Bullhorn and keep your system of record accurate.

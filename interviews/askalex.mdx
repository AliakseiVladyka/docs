## Ask Alex: Your AI recruiting partner

Ask Alex is a feature that supports recruiters while they review candidate score reports. You can think of it as a teammate who has read the full report, understands the job description, and can quickly highlight key insights to help you decide whether a candidate should move forward.

When you open a candidate’s score report, you’ll see an Ask Alex chat panel on the right-hand side of the screen.

## What Ask Alex can do

The chat window lets you ask questions about the candidate, their answers, and the job. Alex only uses information associated with that candidate and role, including:

- The candidate’s score report
- The interview transcript
- The candidate’s resume, if it is attached
- The job description for the position

Each conversation is specific to a single user and candidate. Ask Alex does not cross-reference other candidates or share insights between different reports.

## Example questions you can ask

You can ask Alex a wide range of questions to speed up your review. For example:

- “What parts of the candidate’s past experience are most relevant to this role?”
- “Summarize how the candidate described their approach to this type of work.”
- “What examples did the candidate give that show their motivation or attitude?”
- “How did the candidate talk about collaborating with teammates or cross-functional partners?”
- “What are the strongest indicators that this candidate is a good fit?”
- “Did anything in the candidate’s answers raise concerns or suggest we should look more closely?”

These types of questions are especially useful when you want a quick second opinion or a concise summary before deciding to shortlist or reject a candidate.

## Limitations

Ask Alex is intentionally scoped to a single candidate and role:

- It is not a comparison tool; it does not have access to other candidates’ data or benchmarks for side-by-side comparison.
- It does not analyze or view the interview video itself.
- Its responses are grounded in the score report, job description, resume (if provided), and question content.

The feature is designed to increase clarity and speed for individual candidate reviews, not to replace your own judgment or perform ranking across a pipeline.

## Sharing feedback

Ask Alex is an early-stage feature and is being actively refined. If you have ideas for improvements, run into issues, or want to share how your team is using it, reach out to the product contact at the published support email so the team can incorporate your feedback into future updates.

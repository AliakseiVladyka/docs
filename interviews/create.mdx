## Getting started

There are several ways to create a new job and interview in Alex:

1. Open the **Jobs** page and click **Add Job** in the top-right corner.
2. Choose the interview modality:
   - Phone
   - Video
3. Click **Continue**.

Depending on your subscription, you might see only one modality. If you prefer to build everything manually, you can skip ahead to the [Starting from scratch](#starting-from-scratch-and-ats-driven-creation) section.

If you use an ATS and want Alex to automatically generate interviews based on new jobs, see [Auto Job Generation](/integrations/auto-generate).

## Starting from a job description

Most interviews start with an existing job description (JD). You can provide it in a few ways:

- Paste the JD into a text box.
- Upload a `.docx` file containing the job description.
- Pull from your ATS by entering the Job ID (if supported for your ATS).

You can optionally assign a **Template** here. Templates pre-fill the interview structure, tone, and typical questions so you’re not starting from scratch each time.

After providing the JD:

- Optionally add **Interview Creation Notes** (for example, “Emphasize analytical skills and stakeholder management.”).
- Click **Generate** to have Alex create a draft interview.

## Customizing the interview

Once the interview is generated, you’ll land on the **Create** page. This view contains a fully editable structure derived from your JD and template.

### Introduction

Use the introduction to welcome candidates and set expectations.

- Make sure the introduction ends with a question so candidates know when to start speaking.
- Use variables (like candidate name) to personalize the greeting.

### Editing interview questions

You can refine the question list to match your process:

- **Edit** – Click into a question to change the wording and save.
- **Reorder** – Drag questions to change the order.
- **Delete** – Remove questions that aren’t relevant.
- **Add** – Append new questions or generate new ones with AI.

### Follow-up questions

Follow-ups help Alex dig deeper when needed:

- Expand a question and add one or more follow-ups.
- Without instructions, Alex may or may not ask follow-ups depending on the completeness of the candidate’s answer.
- Limit follow-ups per question to keep the conversation focused.

Best practice: Use follow-ups to clarify vague responses, explore examples in more detail, or branch the conversation based on how the candidate responds. Keep them short and targeted.

### Examples

**Example 1 – Startup experience**

- Main question: Ask whether the candidate has worked in a fast-paced startup.
- If yes: Prompt for a specific situation where priorities shifted quickly and how they adapted.
- If no: Ask how comfortable they are in environments where priorities frequently change.

**Example 2 – Tooling experience**

- Main question: Ask about experience with customer support tools (for example, Zendesk, Intercom).
- If yes: Ask what their day-to-day usage looked like.
- If no: Ask how open they are to learning new tools on the job.

**Example 3 – Leadership**

- Main question: Ask about comfort leading cross-functional meetings.
- If yes: Ask how they keep everyone aligned.
- If no: Ask what they would need to feel more confident in that role.

## AI question suggestions

Alex can propose additional questions based on the JD:

- Click **View suggestions**.
- Skill categories appear automatically, derived from the JD (for example, Communication, Technical Skills).
- Click a category to see question suggestions.
- Click **+ Add** to insert a question into the interview.
- Create new categories by adding a label and saving it.
- Regenerate questions for a skill if you want a different set of prompts.

When regenerating, you can guide the AI by choosing options like:

- More concise
- More open-ended

or by entering your own prompt (for example, “Make questions more technical” or “Focus on conflict resolution scenarios”).

## Context

The **Context** box gives Alex background about the role and company that it can reuse when candidates ask questions at the end of the interview.

- Add high-level information you’re comfortable sharing with candidates.
- Alex references this context when answering questions about the role and company.

<Warning>
If you leave context empty, Alex will not ask if the candidate has questions at the end of the interview, to avoid sharing sensitive details directly from the JD.
</Warning>

Recommended to include:

- Remote vs. in-office expectations (for example, hybrid schedule, primary location).
- Company mission, values, or culture highlights.
- Basic team structure and reporting lines.
- General hiring process timeline and next steps.
- High-level benefits (for example, health coverage and PTO).

Avoid including:

- Internal-only notes or approval details.
- Unfinalized decisions (for example, “still deciding if this is a manager-level role”).
- Confidential roadmap items or sensitive strategy.

## Grading criteria

Alex uses grading criteria to score candidates’ answers:

- You can use automatically suggested criteria (derived from the JD) or add your own.
- Each criterion represents a dimension (for example, communication, problem-solving, technical depth).
- Detailed instructions for each criterion help Alex score more accurately.

For each criterion you can:

- Add new criteria and link them to relevant questions.
- Remove criteria that aren’t needed.
- Adjust priorities or weights so some criteria impact the overall score more than others.
- Edit instructions to define what strong, average, and weak answers look like.

**Example criterion**

- Criterion: Communication
- Instructions: Evaluate whether the candidate’s answer is structured, clear, relevant, and delivered in an appropriate tone.

## Creating tags

Tags highlight specific traits or details in the report. They don’t change the candidate’s score, but they make it easier to filter and search.

Alex can auto-generate tags based on interview content, or you can configure them manually.

### Creating a new tag

1. Click **Add Tag → Create New**.
2. Name the tag (for example, “Work authorization”, “Sales experience”, “Location”).
3. Choose a response format:
   - **Text with options** – Add multiple choices; Alex picks the closest match.
   - **Freeform** – Open text, useful for things like current employer or city.
   - **Date** – For availability or start dates.
   - **Number** – For numeric answers like years of experience.
4. Add instructions explaining what the tag represents and what Alex should look for.

Tip: Each tag should correspond to at least one question in the interview. If you want Alex to extract something, make sure the interview includes a question that surfaces it.

## Advanced settings

Use advanced settings to fine-tune how Alex runs and evaluates interviews:

- **Additional interview instructions** – High-level guidance for Alex’s behavior (for example, keep the tone casual, move quickly if answers are short).
- **Additional evaluation instructions** – Extra scoring guidance or a rubric (for example, how to handle incomplete answers or missing examples).
- **Retakes** – Optionally allow candidates to retake the same interview.
- **Calendar settings** – Define deadlines after which scheduling is no longer allowed.
- **Form inputs (video only)** – Collect inputs like LinkedIn profile, phone number, or resume before starting the interview.
- **Generate questions from resume** – Configure how many tailored questions Alex should create based on the candidate’s uploaded resume.

When you’re satisfied, click **Create** to save the interview.

## Starting from scratch and ATS-driven creation

- **Starting from scratch** – Instead of starting with a JD, you can build an interview entirely manually by adding sections, questions, criteria, and tags yourself.
- **Auto Job Generation from ATS** – If configured, new jobs in your ATS can automatically create corresponding jobs and interviews in Alex, using your default workflow and templates.

## Resume Fit

Resume Fit automatically evaluates how well a candidate’s resume lines up with the requirements of a job. It’s designed to improve candidate quality by using thresholds so only applicants who meet a baseline level of fit move forward. You can also customize the evaluation criteria so the scoring reflects the specific needs of each role.

## For ATS-connected accounts

If your account is connected to an ATS, resumes are pulled in and evaluated automatically as candidates apply. The feature currently supports ATS integrations such as:

- Bullhorn
- Avionte
- Ceipal
- Tracker
- Loxo
- JobDiva
- Manatal
- Salesforce

In these setups, Resume Fit runs in the background and scores candidates based on the job’s requirements.

## For non-ATS connected accounts

You can still use Resume Fit even without an ATS integration:

- **Manual upload** – Upload resumes directly to the candidate’s profile so they can be scored.
- **Required resume upload** – Require candidates to upload a resume during the interview by going to **Interview Kit → Advanced Settings → Form Inputs** and turning resume upload on.

## Viewing Resume Fit details

To see the Resume Fit details for a particular role:

1. Open the **Jobs** tab.
2. Select the job you’re interested in.
3. Locate the **Resume Fit Score** column in the candidate list.
4. Hover over the score to see a detailed breakdown of the evaluation.

This view helps you quickly understand why a candidate received a particular score.

## Customizing Resume Fit evaluation

You can tune how Resume Fit works for each job.

### Adjust minimum requirements

- Go to **Interview Kit → Advanced Settings → Resume Fit Minimum Requirements**.
- Review the automatically generated requirements and remove any that don’t apply using the trash icon.
- Add new requirements with the **Add Requirement** button.

These requirements define the dimensions that the candidate is scored against.

### Set a threshold (ATS only)

In ATS-connected workflows, you can set a Resume Fit threshold in the **Workflows** view, inside the **New Submission** node on the ATS (right-hand) branch.

- Candidates whose Resume Fit score falls below this threshold will not be automatically invited to interviews.

## Resume Fit score analysis breakdown

The detailed Resume Fit analysis includes several key sections:

- **Current role and summary of experience** – A short overview summarizing the candidate’s background and how it relates to the job.
- **Resume Fit score** – A single score, typically shown in the top-right, representing the average of the scores across all minimum requirements.
- **Minimum requirements breakdown** – A table describing how the candidate performed against each requirement, including:
  - **Minimum requirement** – The specific requirement being evaluated.
  - **Score (out of 100)** – How closely the candidate meets that requirement.
  - **Evidence** – Highlights from the resume that support the score.
  - **Gap** – Where the candidate falls short relative to the requirement.
  - **Transferable** – Whether the candidate has related skills or experience that may partially offset gaps.

You’ll also see:

- **Key fit points** – A summary of the candidate’s strengths and positive signals of fit.
- **Areas for discussion** – Items that might require follow-up questions or additional scrutiny.
- **Resume attachment** – The candidate’s resume attached or visible at the bottom of the analysis.

## Resume Fit score instructions

You can further refine how scoring works by adding **Resume Fit Score Instructions**. These let you specify rules about must-have qualifications, deal breakers, and scoring adjustments, so the automated evaluation reflects your preferences.

### How it works

Within the instructions area, you can define guidelines like:

1. **Go-no-go requirements**
   - Define critical criteria that candidates must meet to receive a strong score.
   - Example: If a candidate lacks a minimum number of years of experience in a key skill, their score cannot exceed a specified threshold (for example, they can’t score above 10 in that category).
2. **Scoring adjustments**
   - Adjust scores based on work history patterns.
   - Example: Deduct points for frequent job changes (for example, more than three jobs within a year) or short average tenure.
   - Example: Reduce the overall fit score if average tenure across roles is below a certain number of years.
3. **Additional contextual factors**
   - Add rules for extra positive or negative signals that matter to your team.
   - Example: Add a bonus to the score if the candidate holds specific certifications that are valuable for the role.

These instructions are managed in the **Advanced Settings** section of the Interview Kit, under the Resume Fit configuration. They help ensure the automated score aligns with how your organization wants to evaluate candidates.

## Future enhancements

The Resume Fit feature is actively being improved, with more customization and analysis options planned. Expect additional controls and tuning options to appear over time.

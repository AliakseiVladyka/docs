## Overview

Cheat Detection is an optional add-on that gives Alex an extra layer of awareness during interviews. It uses AI to analyze multiple signals for potential cheating or suspicious behavior, helping you review interviews more confidently.

When enabled, each interview is evaluated by a series of specialized checks, and the results are combined into an overall cheat detection score and recommendation.

## What Cheat Detection does

Cheat Detection monitors interviews using several analyses, including:

- **Multiple people detection** – Detects if more than one person appears in the video frame.
- **Eye and head movement** – Looks for patterns suggesting continuous reading or distraction off-screen.
- **Voice analysis** – Identifies additional voices or sudden changes in voice that may indicate coaching or voice manipulation.
- **Transcript analysis** – Reviews responses for signs of scripted or AI-generated answers and inconsistent behavior.

Interviews that cross your configured threshold are flagged in the report. For flagged interviews, you’ll see:

- A banner or notification indicating the interview was flagged.
- A breakdown of which analyses contributed to the score.

This supports reviewers in applying their own judgment without relying on a single signal.

## Understanding the scores

For each interview, Alex provides a recommendation describing the likelihood of suspicious behavior:

- **Unlikely** – No meaningful indications of cheating detected.
- **Possible** – Some patterns were observed that might be concerning, and the interview may warrant a closer look.
- **Likely** – Strong signs of behavior that could indicate cheating or external assistance.

Each category includes details about which analyses (for example, eye tracking, voice signals, and transcript patterns) contributed to the recommendation. The goal is to surface interviews that deserve additional human review—not to make definitive accusations.

## Enabling Cheat Detection

If Cheat Detection is not currently enabled for your organization:

- Contact your Alex representative or the provided support email to discuss adding Cheat Detection to your plan.
- Once enabled, the Cheat Detection threshold and related configuration appear in **Settings → Interviews**.

## Seeing Cheat Detection in action

Flagged interviews include visual and audio indicators in the report so reviewers can:

- Quickly spot where behaviors were detected.
- Compare the candidate’s responses against the flagged signals.
- Make informed decisions about next steps.

The feature will continue to evolve with richer explanations and additional examples over time.

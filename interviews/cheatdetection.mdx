## Cheat Detection

Cheat Detection is an add-on for Sabina that adds an extra layer of intelligence and awareness to your interviews. It analyzes the interview using multiple AI-driven checks to spot potentially suspicious behavior, helping your team review candidates with greater confidence.

When Cheat Detection is switched on, Sabina runs several specialized analyses during each interview. The results are combined into an overall score, and if that score crosses your configured threshold, the interview is automatically flagged for review.

## What Cheat Detection does

Cheat Detection continuously monitors the interview for risk signals. It runs several checks and aggregates them into a single recommendation. Today, it analyzes:

- **Multiple people analysis** – Detects when more than one person appears in the video frame.
- **Eye and head tracking** – Monitors eye and head movement patterns that may indicate the candidate is reading from another screen or is distracted.
- **Voice analysis** – Identifies external voices or sudden changes in the speaker’s voice, such as someone coaching in the background or using voice-changing tools.
- **Transcript analysis** – Looks at the content of answers for inconsistencies or signs that responses are scripted or generated by AI.

When an interview is flagged, the report view clearly indicates that Cheat Detection has concerns and shows a breakdown of which analyses contributed to the result.

## Understanding the scores

Each interview receives an overall recommendation that reflects how likely suspicious behavior is:

- **Unlikely** – No meaningful indications of questionable behavior were detected.
- **Possible** – Some patterns suggest there could be an issue, and the interview may deserve a closer look.
- **Likely** – Strong signals suggest the candidate might have received outside help or otherwise not followed the intended rules.

The report also breaks down the results for each analysis (for example, eye tracking or voice analysis) to give your team context. The goal is to surface interviews that need human review, not to make definitive accusations of cheating.

## Don’t have Cheat Detection yet?

If Cheat Detection is not enabled for your workspace and you’d like to add it, contact your Sabina representative via the published support email. They can help you turn the feature on and configure it for your team.

## Want to see it in action?

When Cheat Detection flags an interview, the report includes visual indicators and audio-related notes so reviewers can quickly see where issues may have occurred. The product team is continuing to add more example reports and refinements over time, so expect this feature to become richer as it evolves.

## Overview

The Greenhouse integration connects Greenhouse jobs to Alex jobs. Candidates can move into a dedicated Alex stage in Greenhouse, where you can trigger AI interviews. Once interviews are completed, scores and reports are pushed back into Greenhouse.

## What we need from you

To set up the integration:

1. In Alex, go to **Settings → Integrations → Greenhouse**.
2. Copy the API key shown there.
3. Send this key to your Greenhouse Account Manager.
4. Greenhouse will configure the connection on their side (typically within 24–48 hours).

When the integration is ready, a new Alex stage becomes available in your Greenhouse pipelines.

## Inviting candidates

Once the Alex stage exists, you can invite candidates individually or in bulk.

### Invite candidates individually

1. In Greenhouse, drag a candidate into the Alex stage.
2. Open the candidate’s profile.
3. Click **Send test to candidate** (the Alex option on the right-hand side).
4. In the modal:
   - Choose the appropriate Alex job (interview) from the dropdown.
   - Assign a grader or owner if required.
   - Click **Send test**.

Alex sends the candidate an invite and handles scheduling and reminders.

### Invite candidates in bulk

1. In the Greenhouse pipeline view, select multiple candidates.
2. Move them to the Alex stage in one action.
3. Use the bulk action to send Alex interviews to everyone in that stage.

## What syncs back to Greenhouse

After candidates complete interviews:

- Scores and reports are uploaded into Greenhouse.
- You’ll see Alex-related information (overall score, links to full reports) associated with the candidate’s record.

This allows hiring managers and recruiters to stay within Greenhouse while still using Alex’s AI interviewing.

## Overview

The Lever integration connects your Lever pipeline to Alex so candidates can be automatically invited to interviews when they reach specific stages. Completed interview data can then be synced back to Lever.

## 1. Enable Lever OAuth

1. In Alex, go to **Settings → Integrations → Lever**.
2. Click **Connect to Lever**.
3. Sign in to Lever when prompted.
4. Click **Accept** to authorize the integration.

This creates a secure OAuth connection between Lever and Alex.

## 2. Configure Lever webhooks

Inside Lever:

1. Go to **Settings → Integrations and API → Webhooks**.
2. Ensure the following webhooks are toggled **On**:
   - Application Created
   - Candidate Stage Change

These events tell Alex when new candidates are created and when they move between stages.

## Customizing your integration

### Adjust the interview invite trigger

By default, Alex sends invites when candidates reach a specific stage (commonly On-site Interview, but configurable).

To change it:

1. In Alex, return to **Settings → Integrations → Lever**.
2. Use the **Trigger Stage** dropdown to select a different stage.

Only candidates moved into that stage will receive Alex interview invitations.

### Additional behaviors

Depending on configuration, the integration can:

- Limit invites to certain jobs or departments.
- Add notes to Lever when interviews are completed.
- Attach or link Alex reports to the candidate record.

Check the Lever integration page in Alex for any additional toggles or options provided in your environment.

## Overview

The Bullhorn integration allows you to view Alex interviews and reports directly inside Bullhorn. After setup:

- Candidate and Job entities get Alex custom tabs.
- Completed interviews generate notes with report summaries on candidate records.
- Optionally, specific candidate fields can be populated from Alex results.

## What the integration does

When a candidate completes an Alex interview:

- Alex adds a note to the Bullhorn candidate record with a summary and link back to the report.
- Depending on configuration, Alex can also update custom fields (for example, overall score or outcome flags).

This keeps recruiters working inside Bullhorn while still getting full visibility into Alex interview performance.

## Steps to integrate

1. **Create or identify an API user in Bullhorn**
   - In Bullhorn, go to **Menu → Admin → Users**.
   - Create or locate the user that will serve as the API user for Alex.
2. **Set credentials for the API user**
   - Open that user’s record.
   - Generate a new password and save it; this becomes the API password used by Alex.
3. **Enter credentials in Alex**
   - In Alex, go to **Settings → Integrations → Bullhorn**.
   - Enter the necessary Bullhorn credentials for the API user (username, password, and other required IDs).
   - Save and test the connection.

Once the connection is successful, Alex can read and write the appropriate data to Bullhorn.

## After setup

You’ll see:

- Alex tabs on candidate and job records with interview-related data.
- Automatic notes when candidates complete interviews.
- Optional field updates and additional automation (for example, mapping shortlist or reject decisions back to Bullhorn fields through workflows).

If you’d like specific fields to be populated with report values, contact Alex support as suggested in the integration docs.

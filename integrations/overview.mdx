## Integrate Alex with your ATS

Alex integrates with a range of ATS platforms to keep jobs, candidates, and interview activity in sync and to power automations.

Connecting your ATS typically allows Alex to:

- Automatically create jobs and interviews from new requisitions.
- Automatically invite candidates to interviews as they apply or reach specific stages.
- Push interview results (scores, reports, notes) back into your ATS.

## Automations

Depending on the ATS, you can usually configure up to two key automations.

### 1. Job generation automation

- When a job is created or opened in your ATS, Alex automatically creates a corresponding job and interview kit.
- Default templates, workflows, and messaging can all be preconfigured.

### 2. Candidate invite automation

- When a candidate reaches a specific stage or applies to a configured job, Alex automatically sends them an interview invitation.
- You can use filters (by job, status, and more) so not every candidate is invited.

Once connected, most ATS integrations also support:

- Automatic upload of scores and reports.
- Notes or activities appended to candidate records.
- Optional tagging or custom field updates.

For details, see the individual quickstart pages for each ATS integration.

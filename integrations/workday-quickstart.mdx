## Overview

The Workday integration connects Alex to your Workday tenant using an Integration System User (ISU). It enables secure data exchange between Workday and Alex while maintaining proper access controls.

OAuth and appropriate domain security policies are required for this integration.

There are three main phases:

1. Workday security configuration.
2. Workday assessment configuration.
3. Alex configuration.

## 1. Workday security configuration

### Create the Integration System User (ISU)

1. Log in to Workday with administrator credentials.
2. Search for **Create Integration System User**.
3. Create a dedicated ISU account for Alex (non-person user).
4. Set a strong password and follow any internal security policies.

### Create a security group

1. In Workday, create a new security group for the ISU (integration-type group).
2. Add the ISU to this group so the integration user inherits the correct permissions.

### Assign domain security policies

Assign the necessary domain security policies to the security group, such as:

- Access to job requisitions and positions.
- Access to candidate or applicant data.
- Access to assessment-related objects.

After granting these permissions, activate the security policy changes in Workday.

### Register the API client

If your setup uses OAuth:

1. Register an API client in Workday associated with the integration.
2. Note down client ID, client secret, and token endpoint details.
3. Ensure the client is allowed to act on behalf of the ISU.

## 2. Workday assessment configuration

Configure Workday so that Alex can be used as an assessment provider:

- **Statuses**
  - Define application statuses that reflect when candidates should be invited to Alex interviews and when assessments are complete.
- **Assessment setup**
  - Configure an assessment integration or step that corresponds to Alex interviews.
- **Business process configuration**
  - Insert the assessment step into the relevant business process (for example, job application or interview workflow) so Workday will trigger Alex at the right time.

## 3. Alex configuration

Once Workday is configured:

1. In Alex, go to **Settings → Integrations → Workday**.
2. Enter the required Workday information:
   - Workday tenant details.
   - API client credentials (if using OAuth).
   - Any environment-specific endpoints or identifiers.
3. Test the connection.

After the connection is verified, Alex can:

- Receive job and candidate data from Workday.
- Send back interview results or status updates depending on your configuration.

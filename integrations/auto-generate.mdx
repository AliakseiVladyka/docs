## Auto Job Generation

Auto Job Generation lets Sabina automatically create jobs and interviews whenever new requisitions are added to your ATS. Combined with workflow-based invitations, this can make your AI interviews run almost entirely on autopilot.

You can enable and configure this feature from **Settings → Auto Job Gen** in the Sabina app.

## Getting started

To turn on Auto Job Generation:

1. Go to **Settings** in Sabina.
2. Click **Auto Job Gen** in the left-hand navigation.
3. Toggle the feature **On** to reveal configuration options.

Once enabled, Sabina will:

- Listen for new jobs from supported ATS integrations.
- Create matching jobs in Sabina using your default settings.
- Optionally start inviting candidates automatically via your configured workflows.

## Core settings

After enabling the toggle, review and set:

- **Default job type** – Choose Video or Phone as the default modality for auto-generated jobs (based on what your subscription supports).
- **Default creation template** – Select the interview template used to build new interviews from each job’s description.
- **Default messaging** – Choose the messaging template used for invitations for auto-generated jobs. You can still adjust messaging per job later.
- **Default workflow** – Select which workflow should handle candidates for these auto-generated jobs (see the Workflows page for details).
- **On create update field (optional)** – Choose a field in your ATS to update when Sabina creates a job (for example, set a field to “AI Interview Created”).

## Job generation filters

Filters control which ATS jobs result in auto-generated Sabina jobs, so you don’t flood the system with test or low-priority roles.

To configure:

1. Click **Add Filter**.
2. Choose whether this filter is part of an AND group or an OR group.
3. Select the entity to filter on (for example, `JobOrder` or `ClientCorporation`).
4. Choose a field and condition (for example, “Job status is Open”, “Client is not Internal”).

Use filters to:

- Exclude internal or test jobs.
- Limit auto-generation to specific departments or brands.
- Only generate jobs when status is set to a particular state.

## Job generation field mappings

Field mappings let you pass additional job data into Sabina so the AI interviewer has more context:

- Map ATS fields like seniority, location, compensation band, or employment type.
- Sabina uses these values, along with the job description, when drafting interviews.

Configured mappings help Sabina tailor questions and scoring to each role without manual setup.

## Introduction

Webhooks let Alex notify your systems in real time when important events occur, such as candidates starting or completing interviews.

When a configured event fires, Alex sends an HTTP `POST` request to your webhook URL with a JSON payload describing the event.

To configure webhooks:

1. Log into your Alex dashboard.
2. Go to **Settings → Integrations → Alex API** (or the equivalent webhook settings area).
3. Add the URL where Alex should send webhook notifications.

## Webhook events

Each event type has a specific payload schema (see the full docs for details). Alex references completed interviews by `reportId`, which corresponds to the `reportId` returned by the Reports API.

The following events are available:

- `session.started` – Triggered when a candidate enters the room with Alex and starts (or resumes) an interview.
- `session.paused` – Sent when a candidate leaves an interview mid-way or the interview is interrupted.
- `session.ended` – Triggered when the conversation with Alex reaches the end of the interview and the candidate can no longer continue.
- `session.completed` – Triggered when the interview has fully processed and the report is ready.
- `session.shortlisted` – Fired when a candidate is marked as shortlisted in Alex.
- `session.rejected` – Fired when a candidate is marked as rejected in Alex.

## Handling webhooks

When receiving webhooks, your endpoint should:

1. Verify authenticity (for example, via a shared secret or signature header if configured).
2. Return a `2xx` status quickly (for example, `200 OK`) to acknowledge receipt.
3. Perform any heavy work asynchronously (queue processing, send emails, update internal systems, and so on).

If your endpoint returns a non-2xx status, Alex may retry delivery according to its retry policy.

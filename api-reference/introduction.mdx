## Introduction

The Sabina API is a RESTful HTTP API that lets you programmatically access candidates, reports, and positions, and receive webhook notifications.

This page covers the base URL, authentication, and response codes used across all endpoints.

## Base URL

All API requests must be made over HTTPS to the following base URL:

```text
https://api.sabina.com/v1/api
```

All endpoints documented under the API reference section are relative to this base.

## Authentication

Sabina uses an API key for authentication.

- Obtain an API key from your Sabina dashboard.
- Include it on every request with the header:

```http
X-API-Key: <API-KEY>
```

Requests without a valid key (or with an invalid key) will be rejected.

Keep your API key secret. Do not embed it in client-side code or public repositories.

## Response codes

Sabina uses standard HTTP status codes:

- **2xx – Request succeeded.** Example:
  - `200 OK` – The request was successful and data is returned.
- **4xx – Client-side error.** Examples:
  - `400 Bad Request` – Invalid or missing parameters.
  - `401 Unauthorized` – Missing or invalid API key.
  - `404 Not Found` – The requested resource does not exist.
- **5xx – Server-side error.** Example:
  - `500 Internal Server Error` – An unexpected error occurred on Sabina’s side.

Check the response body for additional error details where provided.
